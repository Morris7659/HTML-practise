            <h2><u>His Journey and Impact</u></h2>
            <p><strong>Salman Khan, an American educator and founder of the non-profit Khan Academy, stands as a visionary who revolutionised online learning.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>From Analyst to Educator:</strong>Initially a hedge fund analyst, Khan began informally tutoring his cousin in Maths remotely using Yahoo! Doodle images. Recognizing the power of technology to bridge geographical gaps, he soon started recording short video lessons and uploading them to YouTube in 2006. This quickly grew into something far greater.</p>
            <p><strong>The Birth of Khan Academy:</strong>In 2008, Khan officially founded Khan Academy, driven by the mission <em>to provide a free, world class education for anyone, anywhere.</em>What started as a few math videos blossomed into an online platform offering a personalized learning dashboard that covers a vast array of subjects including:<ol type="1">
                <li>Mathematics</li>
                <li>Science</li>
                <li>History</li>
                <li>Art</li>
                <li>Computer Programming</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Innovative Vision and Global Impact:</strong>Khan revolutionised education by championing <i>mastery learning</i> ensuring students fully understand concepts before moving on and shifting lectures to the home and using class time for active problem solving. This approach has scaled globally through <b>Khan Academy</b>, providing over 150 million registered users with free high quality resources in available in multiple languages.</p>
